# Sinatra TDD project using RSpec with Capybara for testing #
## Overview
This is a template created by me for Sinatra. It contains a sample model Question here with tests and code already written. Please use it if you wish, any feedback appreciated.

## Usage
* Clone the repository.
* Run `bundle install` to install required gems. Bundle currently contains `autotest-fsevent` gem, which is probably Mac OS X only.
* Run the server with simple `ruby app.rb`
* Check tests using RSpec: `rspec`
